I wrote blog posts for GradFund in my final year as a PhD student at Rutgers University.

My author page at GradFund with all of my posts is [here](http://gradfund.rutgers.edu/blog/author/kate-oneill).

{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
